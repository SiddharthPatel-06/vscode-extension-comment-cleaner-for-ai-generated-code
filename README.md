# Comment Cleaner Extension for VSCode

## What is this Extension?

- The **Comment Cleaner** extension for Visual Studio Code helps you easily remove comments from your code.
- But it keeps comments that start with `//!` (for example, `//! This is important`), so you don't lose useful notes in your code.

## Key Features:

- **Removes all comments**: It removes single-line comments (`// ...`) and block comments (`/* ... */`).
- **Keeps important comments**: If a comment starts with `//!`, it will not be removed. You can use this special format for comments you want to keep.

## How to Install the Extension?

Follow these steps to install and start using **Comment Cleaner** in your Visual Studio Code:

### Option 1: Install from Visual Studio Code Marketplace

- Open **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode).
- Go to the **Extensions Marketplace**:
  - On the left sidebar, click on the **Extensions** icon (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`).
  - Search for '**Comment Cleaner**'.
  - Click '**Install**' on the extension page.

### Option 2: Install from a `.vsix` file (if you have the file)

- Download the `.vsix` file for the extension.
- Open VSCode.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette.
- Type `Install from VSIX` and select it.
- Choose the `.vsix` file you downloaded and install it.

## How to Use the Extension?

Once you've installed the extension, here's how to use it:

### Open Your Code:

- Open any code file in VSCode (JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.).

### Open the Command Palette:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on your keyboard to open the Command Palette.

### Run the Extension:

- Type '**Remove All Comments Except //!**' and select it from the list.
- This will remove all comments, except those starting with `//!`.

## How to Customize (Optional)

If you'd like to make it even easier to use the extension, you can set up a custom keyboard shortcut for it!

### Search for the Command:

- Look for "**Remove All Comments Except //!**" in the list.

### Assign a Shortcut:

- Click the pencil icon next to the command and set your desired keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + P`).

## Keyboard Shortcut

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette in VSCode.
- Select Remove All Comments Except //! in the search box.
- Click on the command that appears at the top (it should be Remove All Comments Except //!).
- This will automatically remove all comments except those starting with //!.

## Why Use This Extension?

- **Save Time**: Quickly clean up your code by removing unnecessary comments.
- **Keep Important Comments**: Don't worry about losing valuable comments that start with `//!`.
- **Easy to Use**: Just a few clicks or a keyboard shortcut to make your code neat and clean.

## How Does It Work?

When you run this extension, it checks the comments in your code:

- It removes regular comments like `//` and `/* */`.
- It keeps comments that begin with `//!`, so you can mark important ones.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not showing up?

- Try restarting VSCode.
- Make sure the extension is installed properly.

### Not removing comments?

- Make sure you are using `//!` for comments you want to keep.
