## What is Comment Cleaner?

Tired of messy code with too many comments?

This VSCode extension deletes all comments from your code — but smartly **keeps** the ones you mark as important with `//!`.

Removes `//` and `/* ... */` comments  
Keeps only comments starting with `//!`  

Clean code, made easy.

## Why Developers Love It

- One-click to clean up clutter
- Keeps the useful stuff (`//!`)
- Works in seconds – just press a shortcut

## How It Works

### Method 1: Use Command Palette

> Press: `Ctrl + Shift + P`  
> Type: `Remove All Comments Except //!`  
> Hit: **Enter**
